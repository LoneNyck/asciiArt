# asciiArt
Have you ever wanted to make an ASCII art from a picture? Well, i did, so i created this project!
# get_values.py
Use this code to create a matrix where every pixel is the grayscale of a pixel and to save it on a .txt file
# imageCreator.cpp / imageCreator.c
Compile this code, then use the termial line to run it, specifying the input file (the one with the matrix previously created) and the name of the .txt file where you want to store the picture. It's not required to create the output file in advance. The code should do the work by itself once the name is given.
